# LPANNI

Unofficial implementation of "LPANNI: Overlapping Community Detection Using Label Propagation in Large-Scale Complex Networks".



## Introduction

LPANNI is proposed for overlapping community detection. The main idea is based on Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA), which has linear time complexity and is able to detect community structures in large-scale complex networks. However, it does not support overlapping community detection and suffers from low accuracy and instability. Latter works (COPRA, SLPA and DLPA) were proposed to support overlapping community detection, but still suffer from low accuracy. LPANNI introduces the idea of neighbor node influence to distinguish between neighbor nodes during label propagation, and achieves higher accuracy.

The pipeline of LPANNI is as follows:

1. Calculate node importance NI of each node.
2. Calculate node similarity Sim between neighbor nodes.
3. Calculate neighbor node influence NNI between neighbor nodes.
4. Sort all nodes in ascending order according to NI and store them in `vQueue`.
5. In each label propagation iteration:
   1. For each node $u$ in `vQueue`:
      1. It receives multiple dominant labels from its neighbor nodes and forms label set $L_{Ng}$。
      2. Based on NNI and $L_{Ng}$, calculate the new belonging coefficient $b'(c,u)$ of node $u$ to community $c$.
      3. Adaptively delete the useless labels.
      4. Normalize the belonging coefficient of the labels.
      5. Identify the label with maximum belonging coefficient in $L_u$ as the dominant label of node $u$.
   2. If the size of label set and the dominant labels of all nodes don’t change, stop the iteration.
6. Output label set $L_u$ of node $u$, and get community structure.



## Implementation

We implement LPANNI using C++ in Visual Studio 2017. 

Graph data structures are defined in `src/LPANNI/graph.h` . We design data structures basing on the idea of adjacency list. A graph maintains a vector of nodes. Each node in graph maintains a set of adjacent nodes, and the neighborhood relationship is represented by a pair of directed edges `ToEdge`. For efficiency, we manage most of the edge attributes in another data structure `ToEdgeInfo` , and maintain a memory pool for all edges. 

Overall time complexity of LPANNI is $O((k^{\alpha-1}+1)m+(k^2+(T+1)k+1)n)$. 



## Dataset

Real networks:

+ [Com-Amazon Dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Amazon.html): Undirected community with 334,863 nodes and 925,872 edges. It is put under `data/Amazon`.

Synthetic networks:

+ 6*7=42 networks generated by LFR benchmark. They are put under `data/LFR/` .
+ 10 networks generated by LFR benchmark to evaluate time cost. They are put under `data/time complexity/` .

In `src/LFR/`, We provide an Windows executable program to generate LFR benchmark. To generate, run:

```powershell
.benchmark -k {} -maxk {} -mu {} -minc {} -maxc {} -om {} -N {} -on {}
```

For simplicity, run `src/LFR/generate.py` and it will run all commands for you:

```shell
python generate.py
```



## Time Complexity

According to the paper, the time complexity of LPANNI is $O((k^{\alpha-1}+1)m+(k^2+(T+1)k+1)n)$。We test our implementation on a personal computer:

+ Windows 10
+ Intel Core i7-8550U
+ 8.0 GB RAM

We follow the configurations in the paper, and repeat each experiment for 3 times.

Time of community detection:

| Number of Nodes | Time w/o building graph (second) | Time w building graph (second) |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 10000           | 3.08133                          | 3.51267                        |
| 20000           | 7.343                            | 7.81633                        |
| 30000           | 11.7357                          | 12.0133                        |
| 40000           | 16.0267                          | 17.3117                        |
| 50000           | 20.217                           | 22.138                         |
| 60000           | 25.0247                          | 26.8197                        |
| 70000           | 30.1703                          | 32.3223                        |
| 80000           | 35.3657                          | 38.0373                        |
| 90000           | 40.7283                          | 43.0053                        |
| 100000          | 45.9737                          | 48.8713                        |

This result is nearly 2 times faster compared with the time cost reported in the paper (figure 10).


## Query and Visualization

The native graph database [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is used to store the results of community detection and support graph-related queries. The results are managed as labeled and directed graphs in Neo4j, of which the structure is shown below.

| Type         | Labels    | Properties | Meanings                                    |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Node         | Node      | nid        | A node from the orginal datasets            |
| Node         | Community | cid        | A detected community                        |
| Relationship | Relation  | /          | An edge from the orginal datasets           |
| Relationship | BelongTo  | /          | A node belongs to some specific communities |
| Relationship | CenterAt  | /          | A community is centered at a specific node  |

Queries are executed in Neo4j Browser using Cypher, which is a declarative graph query language supported by Neo4j. Neo4j Browser also provides graph visulization for the query results. The two example query related to community dection are shown below.

+ Query for the communities containing a specific node, such as the node with nid = 1.  
  + Cypher:  
    > MATCH (n:Node)-[:BelongTo]->(c:Community)  
    > WHERE n.nid = 1  
    > MATCH (cn:Node)-[:BelongTo]->(c)
    > RETURN c, cn

+ Query for the communities containing nodes of given quantity, such more than 100.
  + Cypher:
    > MATCH (c:Community)  
    > WITH count((:Node)-[:BelongTo]->(c)) AS quantity  
    > WHERE quantity > 100  
    > WITH c  
    > MATCH (cn:Node)-[:BelongTo]->(c)  
    > RETURN c, cn  
    >> For large graphs, this may cause too many matched communities and make the Neo4j Browser crash. It would be better to limit the number of matched communities using "WITH c LIMIT 1" instead of the fourth line "WITH c".
