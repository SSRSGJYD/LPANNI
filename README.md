# LPANNI

Unofficial implementation of "LPANNI: Overlapping Community Detection Using Label Propagation in Large-Scale Complex Networks".



## Dataset

Real networks:

+ [Com-Amazon Dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Amazon.html): Undirected community with 334,863 nodes and 925,872 edges.

Synthetic networks:

+ 6 networks generated by LFR benchmark.



## Time Complexity

According to the paper, the time complexity of LPANNI is $O(hm+kn)$ã€‚We test our implementation on a personal computer:

+ Windows 10
+ Intel Core i7-8550U
+ 8.0 GB RAM

We follow the configurations in the paper, and repeat each experiment for 3 times.

Time of community detection:

| Number of Nodes | Time w/o building graph (second) | Time w building graph (second) |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 10000           | 3.08133                          | 3.51267                        |
| 20000           | 7.343                            | 7.81633                        |
| 30000           | 11.7357                          | 12.0133                        |
| 40000           | 16.0267                          | 17.3117                        |
| 50000           | 20.217                           | 22.138                         |
| 60000           | 25.0247                          | 26.8197                        |
| 70000           | 30.1703                          | 32.3223                        |
| 80000           | 35.3657                          | 38.0373                        |
| 90000           | 40.7283                          | 43.0053                        |
| 100000          | 45.9737                          | 48.8713                        |

This result is nearly 2 times faster compared with the time cost reported in the paper (figure 10).
